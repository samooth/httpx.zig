# TLS 1.3 Protocol

> **X25519MLKEM768 is implemented for both roles, as RFC 10024.** We offer the
> hybrid group first as a client and accept it as a server, so a client that
> offers only the hybrid — the default for OpenSSL 3.5+ — completes the
> handshake. Note that `X25519MLKEM768` names a key-share encoding, not a
> shared-secret rule: Zig's std `MlKem768X25519` is X-Wing, which encodes it
> identically and produces a different secret. See
> [Interop Status](/reference/interop-status).

RFC 8446 defines Transport Layer Security Version 1.3, delivering major security and performance improvements over previous TLS versions.

## Key Improvements in TLS 1.3

1. **1-RTT Handshake**: Halves handshake latency compared to TLS 1.2 by guessing the key exchange algorithm in the initial ClientHello.
2. **Removed Deprecated Primitives**: Obsoletes static RSA key exchange, Diffie-Hellman static groups, SHA-1, MD5, and CBC ciphers in favor of Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) with AEAD ciphers.
3. **Encrypted Handshake**: Certificate messages and extensions are encrypted immediately following the ServerHello.
4. **Resumption (0-RTT)**: Pre-shared key resumption allows early data transmission on the very first round trip.
